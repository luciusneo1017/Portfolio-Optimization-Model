# Portfolio-Optimization-Model

This is a simple portfolio optimization research model based on Markowitz Portfolio Theory.
The model is built according to a constrained MVO (Mean Variance Optimization) function via a monte carlo simulation. The model aims to find the portfolio
with the highest expected returns to standard deviation (as a measure of volatility) ratio.

Regarding what "constrained" means in this context, we refer to the simplest and most straightforward approach:
1) Long positions only, w_{i}
